# SecureEnclaveDemo
## How to implement Secure Enclave in iOS App

SecureEnclaveDemo is an xcodeproject containing helper named as "SecEnclaveWrapper". You can use this wrapper in your project to encrypt/decrypt sensitive data using Secure Enclave.
The SecEnclaveWrapper class is using SecureEnclave to generate keys and use them to encrypt/decrypt sensitive data.
The SecureEnclave support is only available for iOS 10+.

We usually save data persistently in the app using UserDefaults, Keychain, Core Data or SQLite.
for ex- to save session of logged in user, we save username and password.

But this process puts our data at high security risk 

So its always recommended to store sensitive data in encrypted format. but again its a challange to secure keys used in encryption/decryption.

Well, here secure enclave comes in the role.

The Secure Enclave is a hardware-based key manager thatâ€™s isolated from the main processor to provide an extra layer of security. Using secure enclave we can create the key, securely store key, and perform operations with that key. Thus makes it difficult for the key to be compromised. Here we r using secure enclave in key generation and encryption/decryption.
